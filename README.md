# Real-Time Parking Space Monitoring System

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a real-time parking space monitoring system that utilizes IoT sensors for detecting occupancy and availability. It includes a mobile application that provides users with up-to-the-minute parking availability information and guidance.

## Project Objectives

- Real-Time Parking Space Monitoring
- Mobile App Integration
- Efficient Parking Guidance

## IoT Sensor Design

### Sensor Selection
- Occupancy sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, infrared) are chosen for accurate detection of parking space occupancy.

### Power and Connectivity
- Sensors are powered efficiently and connected to a central hub (Raspberry Pi) via a reliable communication protocol (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy).

### Installation Strategy
- Sensors are strategically placed to cover the entire parking area, minimizing blind spots. Weatherproofing and durability are considered for outdoor deployment.

### Data Accuracy and Redundancy
- Redundancy and error-checking mechanisms are implemented to ensure accurate occupancy data. Fail-safes are included for sensor malfunctions or connectivity issues.

## Real-Time Transit Information Platform

### User Interface Design
- A user-friendly mobile app interface is created, prioritizing features like real-time availability, navigation, secure payment, and user feedback.

### Location Services Integration
- GPS or other location-based services are used to accurately identify the user's current location and guide them to available parking spaces.

### Push Notifications
- Push notifications are implemented to alert users about parking availability changes or special promotions.

### User Feedback and Reporting
- A feedback system is integrated to allow users to report issues or suggest improvements. This feedback is monitored to enhance the system.

## Integration Approach

### Raspberry Pi Setup
- Raspberry Pi devices are configured with necessary software libraries, drivers, and connectivity settings. They are adequately powered and networked.

### Sensor Data Collection
- Software on Raspberry Pi collects data from the sensors at regular intervals, with error handling and data validation mechanisms in place.

### Data Processing and Storage
- Sensor data is processed to determine parking space availability and stored securely in a database for retrieval by the mobile app.

### API and App Communication
- APIs are developed on the Raspberry Pi to enable secure communication with the mobile app, using protocols like HTTPS.

### App Updates and User Interface
- The mobile app is configured to request and display real-time parking availability data from the Raspberry Pi, ensuring seamless integration and responsiveness.

## Testing

Thorough testing is conducted at each stage, including sensor deployment, Raspberry Pi communication, and mobile app functionality. The system is iterated and refined based on user feedback and real-world usage.
